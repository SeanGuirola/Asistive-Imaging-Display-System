# Asistive-Imaging-Display-System

It is probably wise to not use this version since we never made it work with the custom cut glass since we realized the dimensions wouldn't support our custom glass size and that it had many issues with the Fusion 360 history and naming scheme which is not standard across commmon 3D modeling practices. This version upload is more-so for documentation history to see the work that had been done to get it as far as the most recent version upload.
