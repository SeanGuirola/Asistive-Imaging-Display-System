# Asistive-Imaging-Display-System

The Asistive-Imaging-Display System will be a take to see how cheaply we can create a fully function extended reality display system similar to the Microsoft Hololens using only equipment that we are able to procure such as 3D printers that are pretty much common place and to see how reasonable it is to create it from scratch without the thousands of dollars that Microsoft has to poor into R&D. We started this project as Freshman In Highschool and it shows our diffrence and devlelopment of skills over time, in software development, CAD, PCB desiging, talking to companies in a very "start-up" company fashion. We hope this product eventually comes together into something quite usefull and afforable some day. I hope to begin uploading old versions for documentation and revsion review. Hopefully by documenting this it shows the process of engineering and we both learn something along the way. This is meant to be open sourced designs if you have any additions you would reccomend feel free to reccomend them
