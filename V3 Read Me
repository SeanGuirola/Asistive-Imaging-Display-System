This is an obsolete variant now that we are on V5, it doesn't come with screen reinforcments like it should but those are pretty easy to model, if I recover the files I will upload them here. The main benefit If my memory serves the main benefit of this model was that I sat down to do the Snell's Law math for perfect reflection and since the inside of this model was so large I realized we can save forhead protrusion space by designing the glass partially diagonal so that the screens don't lay flat internally, the issue was that I didn't want to use adhesive to secure the tranparent glass, it was top heavy and It mainly served as a proof of concept that we could indeed make an AR display cheaper the hololens that was still pretty open source in terms of hardware and eventually software and be cheaper to produce than $300. This design screens and all without Tarrifs or taxes cost us $3 in PLA, $132 with tax on the dispaly, $20 on the custom panes of glass and wires aren't that expensive so call it $5 in other materials that was $160 to produce which was prety good considering when you mass produce displays the cost decreases. 
  V4 is where the real impressive stuff starts to happen but V3 is the headset that we made our first video on (https://youtu.be/PzD-z2eornw?si=7BuRZ1J3rVd9SGDh)
